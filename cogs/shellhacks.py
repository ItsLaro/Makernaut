# Link My Discord? 

Despite being fully in person, Discord remains as one of our main forms of instant communication during the event. Not only that, it's also the perfect place to meet, socialize and coordinate with fellow hackers before and during the event. 
Only hackers that are *Confirmed* or *Checked In* will be able to complete this process and gain access to the entirety of the channels designed for ShellHacks.

In addition to associating your Discord user with your ShellHacks account, the name on the application will be set as your server's nickname. 
This is important to foster a warmer and safer community and will only be visible to others in the server.  

_**Note 1:** This is not a replacement to your physical check in at the venue on Friday._
_**Note 2:** If a channel below is displayed as "No Access", it means it's still not publicly available._
_**Note 3:** This is only for Hackers; Sponsors and Mentors, expect to hear from us soon!_

# Things to Try Here

‚Ä¢  An Annoucement channel ({self.announcement_channel.mention}) will be used to broadcast important information exclusive for those already at ShellHacks.
‚Ä¢  Still don't have a team? Missing one or two members? Head over to the Team Building channel ({self.team_building_channel.mention}), where you can join forces with fellow hacker.
‚Ä¢  You can use the ({self.support_channel.mention}) to submit a ticket where a mentor can assist you, or ask hackathon related inquiries to MLH staff or our Organizers.
‚Ä¢  In the Sponsor channel ({self.sponsor_channel.mention}) you'll find a digital space to connect with our sponsors.
‚Ä¢  Some of these channels will only become available closer to the event, including additional ones for workshops, activities and other social spaces.
